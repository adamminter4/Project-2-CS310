	 ;*************Art Major based Course Plans************ ;
	 ;I started with the Science based course plans, as I am:
	 ;more familiar with them. For an Art major, I've just  ;
	 ;determined that each has their major requirements, and;
	 ;made up the other requirements. For example, I simply ;
	 ;have all BA students take a language path, on top of  ;
	 ;normal GECs. I added in International Studies for this;
	 ;very reason, since it would add to the grammar, and   ;
	 ;won't be too hard to write.                           ;
